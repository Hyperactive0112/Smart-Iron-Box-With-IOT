# Smart-Iron-Box-With-IOT
This project is aim to developing a frequent problem that our clothes get burnt while ironing. This mainly happens when the iron box is left idle when attending any phone calls or engaging in any other activities and 
also to save the power consumption. Mainly iron box switch ON through Wi-Fi connection, when Wi-Fi is connected to iron box then the circuit will ON. Here we used buzzer for indication when iron box get OF condition,
the buzzer gives beep indication to the user. 
                The Smart Iron detects the position of the iron and allows the user to set an idle time at different positions. The circuit will switch OFF the iron box when it is not in use (no motion),in the rest position.
Wireless Communication is the fastest growing and most vibrant technological areas in the communication field. Wireless Communication is a method of transmitting information from one point to other,
without using any connection like wires, cables or any physical medium. Nowadays conveying messages at large using notice boards are widely used ones ranging from schools to organizations.
We know the significance of notice boards in public areas like bus stands, railway stations, airports, and banks, etc. But day to day changing these boards is a very difficult task and a waste of time.
The major drawback of designing these boards is; not flexible and cannot be located anywhere due to messy wire. To overcome this problem, a wireless board is designed to display the latest information.
